This is a synthesizer that analyzes the sound samples in Sounds folder to create synthesize the given MIDI files to wav files through synth functions in functions folder.
MIDI files are analyzed with the functions in private folder. The credits are given in the .m files for those functions.
Only synth functions are created by me for a school project which are the functions in the functions folder (except the external functions folder). 
The main focus was given to the sounds with harmonic sounds, but the percussion analysis is roughly done (needs a lowpass filter at the end of the perc synthesis, but somehow NaN values are resulted, so it is omitted).
There are comments in the codes, also read the word document for more information.
Currently, I am not planning to update the functions.
Everyone is welcome to do whatever they want with the four functions in the functions folder.


Some Info

- Functions are in the functions folder

- Requires Signal Processing toolbox

- Add all folders of this_is_synth to path

- Run file_selector_for_extractor.m to get the power spectrums and envelops (they are already there)

- Run main.m to synthesize the song
